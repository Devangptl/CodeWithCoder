            <br>
            <p class="intro-in">What is CSS?</p>

            <p>CSS is a language that defines the design and layout of web pages. In other words, CSS controls how web
                pages look when loaded in a browser. We call this design and layout the “style” of the page. CSS is the
                standard language for styling and typically works in conjunction with HTML (the language that defines
                the content of web pages).
                <br>
                <br>
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. “Style Sheets” refers to the CSS document itself, and “Cascading”
                refers to how style rules are applied to page elements. I’ll explain what that means in more detail
                later on, but let’s first learn what CSS does.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="intro-in">What is use CSS</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                CSS is used for defining the styles for web pages. It describes the look and formatting of a document
                which is written in a markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used
                with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is easier to make the web pages presentable using CSS. It is easy to learn and understand and used to
                control the presentation of an HTML document. CSS helps us to control the text color, font style, the
                spacing between paragraphs, sizing of columns, layout designs, and many more. It is independent of HTML,
                and we can use it with any XML-based markup language.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is recommended to use CSS because the HTML attributes are being deprecated. So, for making HTML pages
                compatible with future browsers, it is good to start using CSS in HTML pages.
            </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p class="intro-in"> What is the difference between HTML and CSS? </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                HTML and CSS go hand-in-hand in building the web pages we know and love. However, these are distinct
                languages, and it’s important to understand their different purposes.
                <br>
                <br>
                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) determines the contents of a web page, including text, links, images,
                videos etc. An HTML file lists all of the “things” on a page, but it doesn’t specify how these things
                look when displayed in a browser.
                <br>
                <br>
                CSS, as we now know, controls the style of these elements. CSS ensures the HTML contents appear to users
                the way it was intended by designers.
                <br>
                <br>
                You might be wondering: Why separate these two languages? It’s a reasonable question, since HTML and CSS
                work together. The answer is that separating style and content makes developing websites much, much
                easier.
                <br>
                <br>
                A brief history lesson: When HTML was first introduced in the 1990s, styling was much less of a
                consideration — the focus was more on just presenting information on a web page. Once developers had
                that down, the next step was adding rudimentary visual embellishments like colors and fonts.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first implementation of HTML styling was special HTML tags and attributes that would affect how the
                text looked. This tacked-on solution worked, but it was far from ideal for designers, especially as
                websites grew. Those building large online properties had to apply styling to every page element within
                each HTML file.
                <br>
                <br>
                You can imagine how this would become a tad maddening. Hence, CSS was created to style HTML without
                having to change the HTML files directly. Since then, there have been several updates to CSS that add
                new capabilities — the current standard is CSS3.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="intro-in"> Benefits of CSS </p>
            <br>
            <p>As it turns out, there are multiple benefits to separating content code from style code. These include:
            </p>
            <br>
            <li><span class="span-li">Less coding:</span> Developers can use CSS to apply the same styling to multiple
                pages and page elements across
                a website, saving huge amounts of time and reducing the chance of errors. Modifying a site-wide style
                requires changing just a snippet of code.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span class="span-li">More styling options:</span> You can do a lot with CSS, much more than was
                permitted by the original HTML
                styling system. With a clear vision, CSS know-how, and some patience, you can customize a website
                exactly to your preference.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span class="span-li">Standardization:</span> Since CSS is the uniform language for styling web pages, a
                developer or designer can
                understand the styling for any website by looking at the CSS files.</li>
            <br>
            <li><span class="span-li">Better performance: </span>CSS reduces the amount of repetitive styling code. Less
                code means smaller files,
                and smaller files mean faster page load times.</li>

        <p class="intro-0">CSS Working </p>
        <p class="intro-in">How to Write CSS </p>
        <br>
        <p>We’ve explored why the CSS language does and why it’s important (other than what “cascading” means — we’ll
            get there, trust me). Now, let’s code some.
            <br>
            <br>
            Those familiar with HTML will notice that CSS syntax looks a little different. Instead of listing page
            content, CSS lists the style rules that are assigned to HTML elements, an entire HTML document, or even
            multiple HTML documents. These rules are processed by the web browser loading the HTML file.
            <br>
            <br>
            A rule in CSS looks like this:

        </p>
        <br>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LV2OI0TM.png?resize=1536%2C500&ssl=1">
        <br>

        <p>You’ll notice four main components: a selector, declarations, properties, and values. Let’s break down each
            of these.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="intro-in-in">What is a CSS Selector?</p>
        <br>
        <p>A CSS rule always begins with a selector. The selector indicates the part of the document where the rule is
            applied. When processing CSS code, the browser uses the selector to “select” the targeted elements and apply
            style rules to them. The selector is followed by one or more declarations inside curly braces.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Egz9v5QVoAAVHRW?format=png&name=medium" alt="">
            <br>
            <br>
            There are a handful of ways to write a selector. The most basic type of CSS selector is the element
            selector, used in the example above. The element selector targets HTML elements by their names (e.g., p,
            span, div, a):
        </p>

        <br>
        <p class="intro-in-in">What is a CSS declaration?</p>
        <br>
        <p>After the selector comes the declaration block, a pair of curly braces containing one or more CSS
            declarations. A CSS declaration tells the browser how to style the selected element — it consists of a
            property and a value.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <br>
            Each declaration ends with a semicolon. Though not required, it’s common to place each declaration on a new
            line. This practice makes CSS declaration blocks easier for humans to read.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p class="intro-in-in">What is a CSS property?</p>
        <br>
        <p>As the first part of a CSS declaration, a CSS property tells the browser what style feature of the element
            should be changed. There are many CSS properties that affect different things. For example, a property can
            target an element’s color, size, font, shape, or location on the page. A property is always paired with at
            least one value. A property and its value(s) are separated by a colon.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/css/images/syntax.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <br>
            Before we talk about values, one important note: For a declaration to take effect, the browser must
            recognize the property of the declaration. Unfortunately, just because a CSS property exists doesn’t mean it
            works in every browser. When new properties are introduced, web browsers need to implement them, and some
            browsers are faster to adopt new CSS features than others.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="intro-in-in">What is a CSS value?</p>
        <br>
        <p> Every CSS property has its own set of values. The value specifies the styling of an element’s property. Here
            are
            some common properties and their values:</p>
        <br>
        <li>Color-related properties can take simple one-word values like blue and red, as well as hex codes —<span>
                #33E0FF</span> and <span>#FF5733</span> — and RGB values — <span>rgb(51, 224, 255) </span>and
            <span>rgb(255, 87, 51)</span>.
        </li><br>
        <li>The width property takes can take a length value —<span> px </span>(pixels), for instance — or a percentage,
            which sizes the element relative to the width of the parent container. For instance, a
            <span>"div"</span>inside the<span>"body"</span> tag set to 50% width will span half the width of the
            viewport.
        </li><br>
        <li>The <span>font-family</span> property accepts the written names of web-safe fonts like<span> Arial, Times
                New Roman,</span> or<span> Courier.</span></li><br>
        <br>
        <p class="intro-in-in">CSS Comments</p>
        <br>
        ike with HTML, you can write comments in CSS. Comments are ignored by the browser and are useful in providing
        context and notes for your code.
        <br><br>
        To comment in CSS, write<span> /*</span>, then your comment text, then end with<span> */.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="intro-in">How to Add CSS to HTML </p>
        <br>
        <p>Of course, CSS doesn’t do us much good if it’s not linked to an HTML file. In this section, I’ll cover three
            ways to add CSS to HTML: external, internal, and inline.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="intro-in-in">External CSS</p>
        <br>
        <p>External CSS exists in its own file. This file is linked to an HTML document with a
            <span>"link"</span> tag. External CSS is the most common method for adding CSS to HTML, since one external
            stylesheet can
            dictate the style of multiple HTML documents. This enables developers to make site-wide changes with just
            one CSS file.
            <br>
            <br>
            To create a CSS file, write your CSS code in any text editor or code editor and save the file with the .css
            extension. To link your CSS file to an HTML file, place your HTML file and CSS files in the same folder,
            then paste the following code inside the
            <span>"head"</span> section of the HTML file:

        </p>
        <br>
        <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1100/1*HZRsQBatRPss8JMqpsXWJw.png">
        <br>
        <p class="intro-in-in">Internal CSS</p>
        <br>
        <p>Internal CSS is CSS code embedded in an HTML document. It is written inside the <span>"style"</span> element,
            which is placed in the<span> "head"</span> section:</p>
        <br>
        <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/828/1*BUQ1fJAxb0-7VXu4sV3fbg.png" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>Internal CSS is best used for small web projects and individual web pages with their own styling. In these
            cases, it might be easier to keep all your code in the same file, rather than jumping between two — it just
            comes down to your preference.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="intro-in-in">Inline CSS</p>
        <br>
        <p>Inline CSS is placed inside an HTML tag to change the style of a single specific element. Inline syntax is
            slightly different than what we’ve seen — the declaration is written as the value of the <span>style</span>
            attribute:</p>
        <br>
        <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1100/1*W4XE0mJpm_c1Uiai4nvyxA.png" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>But hold on...doesn’t this violate the practice of separating style from content? Yes, which is why its use
            is generally discouraged. Inline CSS is both inefficient to program and harder to understand than external
            and even internal CSS. Still, it’s good to know in case you ever see it.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="intro-in">CSS Cascade, Specificity, and Inheritance </p>
        <br>
        <p>Up to this point, the concepts we’ve explored so far are relatively straightforward — CSS is a list of style
            rules applied to HTML. Each rule corresponds to one or more page elements. CSS can be applied externally,
            internally, or inline. Piece of cake.
<br>
<br>
            However, in your early CSS tinkering, you’ll likely encounter a situation in which your page elements look
            different than you expect. You’ve written all of your rules correctly and checked for browser compatibility,
            and your code still doesn’t seem to work. Why is that?
<br><br>
            The reason is, in addition to the basic principles we’ve covered, CSS has some built-in systems that control
            how your code affects page elements. To prevent confusion for your future self, there are three more
            important CSS terms you should know: cascade, specificity, and inheritance. Let’s unpack each of these.</p>
